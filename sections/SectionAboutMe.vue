    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I am Filip and I work as a software developer. I am focused on web
      development, but I enjoy getting out of my comfort zone and trying other
      aspects of IT in my free time. I am fairly interested in low level
      programming and reverse engineering. Not on a professional level by any
      means, but there is something fascinating about this and its quite
      refreshing when I work on web dev 8 hours a day. Professionally, I did
      lots of different frontend and backend jobs. Mostly I work with javascript
      / typescript and Java (specifically using Springboot) but I learn new
      technologies pretty fast, so I am not afraid of trying something else
      every once in a while. If you want more information about my experience,
      at the bottom of the page you can find a list of my employers with
      descriptions of my responsibilities.

      As my hobby I really enjoy playing video games and making music. You can
      see some of my covers on my instagram and YouTube. There are not many of
      them at the moment, but I am planning to start doing more.
