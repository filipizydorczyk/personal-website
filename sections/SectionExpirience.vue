        I continued path of the web developer at
        <a href="https://www.emakina.com/int-en" target="_blank">Emakina</a>
        that was later acquired by
        <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank">EPAM</a>. Initially, I
        was hired to do frontend work this time, but I had the freedom to work
        on backend as well. As a result, I worked as a fullstack developer doing
        websites and web applications. I used React and Vue.js and Java for
        backend. My responsibilities were fixing bugs, creating new features
        based on Jira tickets, attending dailies, grooming sessions and dailies,
        writing automated unit tests for code I wrote, doing code reviews. I did
        also experience a bit of Azure again and worked with MySQL database.

        Another internship took place in
        <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/" target="_blank">Capgemini</a>
        where I was initially hired with the intention of me doing Java
        development, but I ended up doing frontend using react for an internal
        project. The biggest challenge in here was working with IoT for the
        first time and creating dashboards for the devices based on provided
        documentation. I also did learn a little about cloud infrastructure
        using Azure. Very cool stuff, but it was not something I was interested
        in at the time, so I decided not to continue there and look for
        something else.

        <a href="https://www.sealcode.it/" target="_blank">Sealcode</a> was my
        first real IT internship. I got there thanks to an internship program
        from my university and after that, I did some contract jobs for them
        since they were happy with my performance. I started working with a team
        on their company
        <a href="https://www.sealcode.it/" target="_blank">website</a>. The
        whole idea was to write responsive components accordingly to the designs
        and then use them on the actual website. The entire website was rendered
        to static html files which resulted with great preformance. I worked on
        other websites in a similar fashion for their clients as well. I also
        worked on
        <a href="https://github.com/sealcode/sealious" target="_blank"
          >sealious</a
        >
        which is their own declarative backend framework. I started with fixing
        bugs to get familiar in a project and then started to doing new features
        as well. This project made me familiar with many concepts such as
        integration tests or CI/CD. Whenever a client needed a web app that
        required some kind of backend, sealious was what we were using. They
        used to use react for single page applications but with time, technology
        was changed to
        <a href="https://hotwired.dev/" target="_blank">hotwire</a> to pursue
        server side rendering.

        In <a href="https://hobbajt.pl/" target="_blank">hobbajt</a> I actually
        started as an IT teacher for kids but I quickly started to help with
        their clients websites. It was mainly WordPress. For the most part, I
        was responsible for creating backups and fixing broken stuff after
        updating their extensions. But from time to time there were more
        chalenging tasks as well. Sometimes it was needed to add custom css to
        get UI elements that were not achievable with the theme itself and
        sometimes it was missing functionality that we needed to add. If there
        was no extension matching clients needs, we had to add this
        functionality with either JavaScript or php. We also created the entire
        website from scratch using wordpress with Elementor (wordpress
        extension).
